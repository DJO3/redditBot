A simple reddit bot that will do the following:

1. It will monitor a particular subreddit for new posts, and when someone posts “We ran out of cat food”, it will reply “So it has come to this...”.

2. It will also monitor all comments to recent posts, and if it finds one that says “xkcd”, it will post a link to /r/pythonforengineers and direct the commentor to https://xkcd.com/1022/.
